<a name="why"></a>
## Why? ##
This boilerplate was created to facilitate the start and standardization of projects with react. Usually JavaScript projects do not follow a strict standard. As a consequence each one gets its structure and responsibilities in different places, making maintenance and immersion for new developers difficult.

## Quick start ##

For now the easy way to use the boilerplate would be just cloning the repo and resetting git.

**1. Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone REPO
```
**2. Go to project directory**
```bash
cd <project-path>
```
**3. Remove .git**
```bash
rm -rf .git
```
**4. Init fresh git**
```bash
git init
```
**5. Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

*6. (Optional) You probably wanna add `/dist` to .gitignore*

## Scripts ##

**Development**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Build**
```bash
npm run build
```

**Serve build**
```bash
npm run serve
```

**Lint**
```bash
npm run lint
```

<a name="env"></a>
## Environment Variables ##

It's is important to duplicate `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. There is two properties that are required by default for the boilerplate work properly: `PUBLIC_URL` and `API_URL`.

Can be in your interests to create more than one `.env` file. To automate the usage of this files, simply go to `webpack.config.js` and find the `Dotenv` plugin. Inside its options change the path logic.

*Exemple:*
```javascript
...
path: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? './.env.prod' : './.env',
...
```
